<h4>Key Concepts:</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Operator - a group of persons engaged directly in the provision of the service, as well as in the development, administration and support of the<a href="https://www.romanenkova.com">https://www.romanenkova.com site</a>;</li>
    <li>User - any visitor to this site;</li>
    <li>Website - a set of graphic and information materials, as well as computer programs and databases, ensuring their availability on the Internet at the network address<a href="https://www.romanenkova.com">https: / /www.romanenkova.com</a>;</li>
    <li>Third Party - any person, group of persons or company engaged in the development, administration and support of the Website, which does not apply to either the User or the Operator;</li>
    <li>Personal data is any information relating directly or indirectly to a specific or definable Website User.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Use of third parties:</h4>
<p>The website uses the following services:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Google Analytics - to collect, analyze and store analytics. Data such as geolocation, computed on the IP of the User, as well as some parameters of the User’s system are being processed;</li>
    <li>Mailgun - for sending, receiving and storing emails and addresses to both the User and the Operator.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Use Local Storage:</h4>
<ol>
    <li>A website may use cookies to run Google Analytics, as well as to store user preferences.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Collection, storage and processing of personal data:</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Email;</li>
    <li>Phone number;</li>
    <li>Last name and first name.</li>
</ol>
<p>Personal data is collected solely to contact you. No advertising materials will be sent to the User. Personal data are generated in an e-mail and arrives in the gmail inbox, and are also processed by the Mailgun service. Telephone and email are not stored in the site database. Name and surname may be saved with the consent of the User.</P>
<p>Any personal data will be removed from all sections of the site upon request. If at the same time the provision of services is impossible, then this conflict is resolved through verbal negotiations.
